    <h1> About Sports Cubed </h1>
      <div class="description">
      The Sportscubed project was developed as a result of a hack at the 
      University of Edinburgh in 2013, a ‘Smart Data Hack’, held at the School 
      of Informatics. The City of Edinburgh Council shared some data to support 
      this event and took part in the judging. Sportscubed was one of the 
      winners, a prototype developed by three first year students. The Council 
      decided to develop the prototype and worked with the students to deliver 
      an app that would encourage young people to take up more physical activity.
      <br/>
      This app is an exciting and innovative digital product, bringing 
      information about sports in the city to a wider audience. The project 
      reflects the strategic approach to digital service delivery that the City 
      of Edinburgh Council is taking, in line with its ICT and Digital Strategy.
