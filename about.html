         Computers and technologies have been in my eyesight ever since I
         started High school since my profile there was Informatics and
         Mathematics. I have been doing web development for the last few years
         but areas like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are also
         part of my interests. For the purpose of the project I was mainly
         using JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5 for the application and Adobe
         Photoshop for the images. Apart from web development I also have
         experience in Python, Java, Haskell a bit in C and in SQL.
         <br/><br/>
         I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of
         Edinburgh. The degree is quite theoretical and therefore the Sports
         Cubed project with the City of Edinburgh Council was a great
         opportunity to gain some more practical experience. And I am not
         talking only about gaining technical knowledge but improving my
         networking and interpersonal skills as well. I learned how to
         effectively work in an agile environment as part of a team.

         At age of 12 I was presented to my first programming language. It was
         event that changed my whole world. My fascination with the subject
         grew and soon after my free time was consumed by a ton of small
         projects. I have been using them as my primary mean of learning ever
         since. This project is no exception.
         <br><br/>
         Nevertheless it is somewhat special for me, since its my first piece
         of work that makes it to the general public. For that reason I have
         put extra efforts and hours of my spare time to perfect it. Despite
         the many sleepless nights, I am confident that it was all worth it. I
         got to work on an unique project with inspiring colleagues and learned
         a ton of new things. Hope you will enjoy the fruits of our hard work
         as much as we did.

         My interest in Informatics and Mathematics was sparked in the time I
         studied at the Sofia High School of Mathematics. During the course of
         my education in the University of Edinburgh I had the opportunity to
         work on a few interesting projects including this project for City of
         Edinburgh Council. I have (had the pleasure to endeavor) endeavored in
         several side projects even though none were released to the general
         public. This task gave me a valuable experience.
         <br/><br/>
         I am interested in developing artificial intelligence algorithms and
         in working on software architecture and design. I did the server side
         of the program, as well as the database and source code management.
